# SparkApp
 Building an ETL process
 Step one was bring in a 60k dataset and bring it into Pyspark
 Step two, was to derive some insights and export that to a pandas dataframe to a new csv.
 Executed a couple of SQL queries, didn't really get too dirty.
 Will bring extracted PySpark DF into PowerBI to give stakeholders a presentation of my Amazing store.
